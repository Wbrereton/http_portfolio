      <p>Hello!</p>

      <p>I have a strong interest in data analytics as well as operations strategy roles and I am looking for an opportunity within your organization. With a professional foundation in business development, product analysis, and team leadership, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Analytics from Western Governors University to deepen my echnical expertise in SQL, Python, Power BI, and data modeling.</p>

      <p>Throughout my career, I’ve led efficiency improvements that reduced operational costs, improved customer experience, and optimized team performance. My passion lies in uncovering actionable insights from data and applying them to solve real-world business problems. This has fueled my transition into analytics, where I now focus on integrating AI, predictive analytics, and strategic dashboards into decision-making workflows.</p>

      <p>What sets me apart is my hybrid ability to think analytically, with established business accumen, while leading cross-functional teams toward shared outcomes. I bring both business fluency and technical capability, a combination that positions me to contribute meaningfully in data-driven environments, especially those with operational needs.</p>

      <p>I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my background aligns with your organization’s goals or how my drive for development can be an asset to your team. Thank you for your time.</p>

      <p>Best,<br />
      Wyatt Brereton</p>
